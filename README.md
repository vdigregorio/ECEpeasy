### Road Blocks
- Filtering data 
- Could not figure out how to pass a username to the socket.io chat
- The database wasn't storing which user created which post
  - this created a bigger problem because my plan was to render the posts of each specific user in their profile routes.
- My original API got rejected by the website I requested the key from
